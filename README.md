## Development Setup

To set up this project for development, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

   ```

2. Install the project dependencies:

Husky is configured to prevent commits that have linting and formatting errors. It also ensures that tests must pass before allowing a push to the origin repository.

## Technologies Used

The portfolio was built using Next.js, a powerful React framework. Its static site generation (SSG) capabilities result in faster load times and better search engine discoverability.

To style the portfolio, Tailwind CSS was employed, providing a utility-first approach to styling.

### React Testing Library 14.0

React Testing Library was utilized for testing components and ensuring the functionality and user experience.

### Jest 29.6

Jest was employed for writing and running tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the codebase.
